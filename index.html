            <h1>BRENT MARCUS P. BARAO</h1>
            <p> As a student of information technology, I'm fascinated by how technology is constantly transforming our world.  I like to solve problems, learn new things, and come up with better ways to accomplish tasks.  Determining how various programs and systems interact and function together is something I enjoy doing when working with computers.

 Basketball plays a significant role in my life outside of school.  It keeps me moving and serves as a reminder of the value of discipline and teamwork in everything I do, including on the court.

 I also adore music.  I can unwind, remain creative, and maintain a healthy work-life balance thanks to it.

 I'm constantly trying to learn new things, develop myself, and apply what I've learned to worthwhile endeavors.</p>
